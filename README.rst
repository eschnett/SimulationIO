Efficient and convenient I/O for large PDE simulations

Current state
-------------

This repository contains a working prototype of a library that can be
used to write and read simulation output, as would be necessary e.g. for
the Cactus framework. There are substantially complete test cases, a
simple example, an ``h5ls`` like utility, and a converter from the
current Cactus format.

Outdated sketches
-----------------

This repository contains a few sketches describing brainstorming results
in various forms in the subdirectory ``sketches``: -
``AMR IO Library.md``: Original document -
``simulations.{gliffy,svg,png}``: Graphical representation -
``SimulationIO.hpp``: Description as C++ header file -
``SimulationIO.jl``: Begin of an implementation in Julia

Ideas
-----

-  Add a UUID to every object
-  canâ€™t just create UUIDs
-  probably need to handle set of UUIDs?
-  Run benchmarks with large datasets
-  Add parallelism
-  Add sub-manifolds, sub-tangentspaces, etc.
-  Allow writing just part of a project, or adding to / modifying a
   project
-  idea: whenever creating an HDF5 object, check whether it already
   exists; if so, check whether it looks as expected
-  Allow removing parts of a project, deleting it from a file?
-  Implement (value) equality comparison operators for our objects
-  Replace H5 SWIG interface with standard Python HDF5 library. To do
   this, obtain low-level HDF5 ids from Python, and create H5 objects
   from these.
-  Allow coordinates that are not fields, but are e.g. uniform, or
   uniform per dimension
-  Create ``Data`` class by splitting off from
   ``DiscreteFieldBlockComponent``
-  Create ``Value`` class by splitting off from ``ParameterValue``?
   Unify this with ``Data``?
-  Range field should use a dataset instead of an attribute
-  In discrete manifold, distinguish between vertex, cell, and other
   centerings
-  Introduce min/max for discrete fields? For scalars only? Keep array
   for other tensor types, indexed by stored component? How are missing
   data indicated? nan?
-  Create DataSpace from vector
-  Implement SILO writer (for VisIt) (or can this be a SILO wrapper?)
-  Measure performance of RegionCalculus

Sub-Manifolds
-------------

-  Set of parent manifolds ### Sub-Discretizations
-  Set of parent discretizations
-  If directions aligned:
-  Map directions: int[sum-dim] -> [0..dim-1]
-  Needs to handle points, lines, planes
-  If commensurate:
-  Grid spacing ratio (rational)
-  Offset (rational)
